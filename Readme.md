# Template for a Tango Device Server
This is a template for what your Readme for a Tango Device Server should look like. This first abstract should summarize what your Tango DS is for.
Direct further documentation of classes or methods used to the <em>docs</em> folder. Make sure the manuals you upload to <em>manuals</em> are freely accessible. 

## Installation
Describe how to install necessary packages (maybe drivers) needed for your Tango DS. Maybe it is needed to install by <code>pip3</code> or clone and install from another git.

## Configuration
(Optional)  
Add some configuration details that need to be set up when registering the Server (which device properties to declare etc.).

## Authors
Refer to your organization and leave some contact details of how to reach you in case there are any questions.
